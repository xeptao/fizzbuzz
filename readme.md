## The Problem

Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity.

- If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz"
- If its divisible by 5, you print "Buzz"
- And if its divisible by both, you print "FizzBuzz"
